#object = container of sth, animals is object or table is one or a data table

#all terms need to be of the same type in a vector
#functions to interact w/ a vector

#length of a vector

#get type of data contained in the vector

#Exercise 1:

#chooses one, R wants vector to be consistent and contain only one type - characters, unverstood from quotation marks in the environment
num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
# num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE) = num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, T) -> type chosen according to numerical

#all became a character
#conversion to character
#R tries to preserve as much info as possible -> 1,2,3 can always become strings but a cannot be a number, therefore everything is a character, True is a 1 and false = 0
#hierarchy -> if logical it can become number=numeric, if numeric it can become a charater but no character cannot be numeric , lovial -> numeric and character
#string is vector of individ characters

#subsetting a vector with []
animals[2] #picking 2nd element
#R starts counting from one, first element first

#gives logical result

#true an falses are selected and then put out as number
weight_g[weight_g > 63 & weight_g < 80]
#& = two logical operators mixed with & only true if both are true

#writing out strings is shit with many options
#check if one of the animals is e.g. a dog -> write a logical condition for each animals to test
